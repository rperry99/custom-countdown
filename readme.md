# Project Name

This is a custom countdown app where the user can enter in a date they would like to countdown to and it will count down. This utilizes localstorage as well so the user can keep their data for their countdown and every time they go back, they will see their coutdown going down.

This project is from [Zero to Mastery: Jacascript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects).
This is project 9 / 20.

## Thoughts

This was another interesting project. I have made a countdown timer in the past, but mine was way more complicated. In the previous one I made on my own, it was more like a kitchen timer where you could set minutes and seconds. The way I did it, was I had the user enter in their time, in seconds (I know, not ideal), then use a for loop to keep looping over the seconds, subtracting 60 every time until you were no longer able to. That was how I got my minutes.

The math used in this one to get days, hours, minutes, and seconds was so much cleaner. It is funny to look back on some past projects.
